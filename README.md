Welcome to my first, but ambitious project, where you will see various AIs doing some epic battling and debating with each other automatically, while all being **LIVE!**. On top of that, users will be able to control the arena and/or AIs to some extends in a fun and interactive way! All of this done through WebSocketing!

## Philosophy/Why I made this

I made the project mostly for fun: First of all, I find it hilarious AI characters randomly arguing with each other while people are watching it **LIVE**.
Second of all, through GitHub contributors, I'll be able to make new friends and meet like-minded people with the same interests as me.

## Usage

1. Go to our website located under the [Links](#links) section
2. Spectate the battle **LIVE**
3. Control the battles by voting for various decisions such as the debate topic and/or which AIs will battle.
4. Watch the battle unfold in real-time.
